# GradientDescentNN
single layer Neural net with 1-output implementation in python
Its an OR gate implementation, n-input and 1-output with initialized 
weights(w) and last value as bias multiplier(-1) not mean to be changed.
weights will get updated as w_new=w_old+c*r*x; r=(d-o), gradient descent 
algo. At the end inputs are taken from user after training weights and 
output is given activation layer is RELU.
